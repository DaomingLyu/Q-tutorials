# Queries for Q training
** NOTE: The current implementation uses a BaseQuery class that contains a reference to a specific Q Workspace**
** Obviously that won't work for anyone else, but in the interest of getting the code up...**
## GetNearbyWellsForLocation
Runs off a main method (for now) that takes a drillinglocation and a number of wells. Values are defaulted. At this point (4/17, 11:53 am) consider this code completely untested (it isn't) and undocumented (it is).
